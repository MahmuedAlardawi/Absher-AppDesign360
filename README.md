King AbdulAziz Universality - Human Interaction (CPCS-381)

## Overview

This project, part of the CPCS 381 course at King Abdulaziz University, focuses on designing an application that solves a specific problem for a target user group. The project emphasizes user-centered design principles, prototype development, and usability testing to enhance user experience.

## Objectives

- Conduct formative research to understand the target users and validate the application concept.
- Develop low, medium, and high-fidelity prototypes, refining them based on user feedback.
- Perform usability testing to gather data and improve the application design.
- Compare different fidelity levels of prototypes and their effectiveness in design communication.

## Project Stages

### Stage 1: Initial/Mid-Level Progress

- **Identify Users:** Develop personas and scenarios to define the target user group.
- **Research Methods:** Utilize qualitative and quantitative methods such as interviews and surveys to gather user insights.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyze the data collected from user studies to refine the application design.

### Stage 2: Final Report and Prototype

- **Prototype Refinement:** Enhance the application design based on user feedback from Stage 1.
- **Video Creation:** Produce a promotional video explaining the application's purpose and functionality.
- **Presentation:** Present the final prototype and video to showcase the project results and future directions.

## Installation

No installation required for the initial design stages. For viewing and testing prototypes, follow specific instructions provided with each prototype version.

## Usage

Details on how to interact with the application prototypes will be provided with the final submission, accessible via designated links or embedded directly in the project documentation.

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit project reports and presentations through Blackboard by the designated deadlines.
- Include a video demonstration of the application, submitted as a link to a publicly accessible platform like YouTube or Google Drive.
